    <div class="tribute-text">
      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>Victor Jara was born into poverty in 1932 in a remote Chilean village. The son of a peasant family who worked the land on a latifundia or semi- feudal landed estate. Their poverty was such that, in order to support the family, Jara was also working on the land by the age of 6, at the behest of his illiterate father. His father would later take to drinking and left Victor and his siblings to be raised by his mother when he was still a child. His mother played the guitar and piano and performed traditional Chilean folk songs at local functions. As well as ensuring that Victor got a good education, she also nurtured Victor’s own artistic talents. She died when Victor was 15.</p>

      <h3>Coming of Age</h3>
      <p>After a brief period studying accountancy and serving in the Chilean army, Victor began to pursue the artistic talents that would make him a folk hero in Chile and around the world. His artistic career began in the theatre in the mid-1950’s. He was awarded a scholarship to the theater program at the University of Chile. It was around this time that Victor met his future wife, Joan Tuner Bunster, a British-born dancer and dance teacher. By the late 1950’s, Victor was gravitating towards folk music as his preferred mode of artistic expression. He released his first album in 1966.</p>

      <h3>Revolution</h3>
      <p>By the late 1960’s, Victor’s own political activism would start to be expressed in his music and he would be come a cultural figurehead for a socialist movement in Chile. Jara supported the aspirations of socialist politician Salvador Allende and wrote the theme song of his Unidad Popular (Popular Unity) movement, "Venceremos" (We Will Be Victorious). Allende was elected to Chile's presidency in 1970. As with many before him who had championed the rights of the dispossessed and sought a more equal and just society, Jara would be silenced in the most brutal fashion by those whose power he hoped to curtail.</p>

      <h3>Murder</h3>
      <p>In 1973, an American-backed military coup overthrew the government and imposed a ruthless dictatorship. Jara was arrested the day after the coup and held in the Santiago stadium. Jara was beaten and tortured. At one point, he defiantly sang Venceremos (We Will Win), Allende’s 1970 election anthem. On the morning of the 16th Jara asked for a pen and notebook and scribbled the lyrics to Estadio Chile, which were later smuggled out of the stadium: “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror/ Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying.” Two hours later, he was shot dead, then his body was riddled with machine-gun bullets and dumped in the street. He was 40.</p>
